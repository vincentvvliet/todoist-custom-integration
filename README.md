# Todoist - Google Calendar custom Integration

This project is dedicated to removing all events from Google Calendar that have been completed in Todoist, but do not originate from Google Calendar. The reason for this is that I would like events from Google Calendar to remain there such that I have an overview of my plans. The feature from Todoist to remove from Google Calendar upon completion in Todoist will also remove items originating from Google Calendar. This project will tackle that limitation.

## Tools
This project will be done in python and will require access to:
- [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview)
- [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v9/#overview)
